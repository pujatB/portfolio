              <p id="welcome">Hey there ! Welcome to my home page. </p>
              <p>My name is Puja Bapat. I was born and brought up in India but now I have been living in the UK for the last 13 years. I am quite a sporty person and badminton is my favourite. I love indian music and I am also a part of a small music group. As well as this, I am a trained yoga instructor and I think yoga is a life skill which everyone should learn.</p>
              <p>I have worked in different sectors but software develpment is my favourite one. I have always loved coding;having multiple solutions to a single problem has always intrigued me. After a long career break, I am hoping to work in the same field again. I have been self-learning HTML,CSS and Javascript and I am enjoying it a lot!</p>
